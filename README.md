# StyleUp
Overview of the defined system:
StyleUp is an interior design planning application that enables users to find personalized style recommendations for the spaces that they are decorating. This includes furniture, art, and other decor elements. The application will also connect users to in person or online retailers where they can purchase these recommendations. These recommendations can be saved to individual rooms that the user can create to contain them, or a simple wish-list to be sorted later. These rooms can be made collaborative, and other users who are made collaborators on them will be able to view their contents and add to or remove from them.

Operational settings:
This application is being developed for personal computers, particularly with laptops in mind. This means that some visual elements of the front-end may not be perfectly compatible with the smaller screen sizes of handheld devices such as smartphones. Though we are not anticipating any need for intense computing power; similarly, performance issues may be present when the application operates on smaller devices, such as smartphones, that it is not designed for.
